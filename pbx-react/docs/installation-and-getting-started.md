# Installation & Getting Started

Install project dependencies: (this is done in [install.sh](./../../install.sh))

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn server
# or...
yarn s
```

Once the dev server is running, you can view the project by opening `http://<your-vms-ip>:9001` in the browser. You may have to append a path to the url depending on the project setup (Eg. `http://<your-vms-ip>:9001`)

## Production

Build the project:

```bash
yarn build
# or...
yarn b
```
